A small example project for loading the plugins was made: https://github.com/sijmenvb/pluginLoaderExample/tree/master. It was quite difficult to get it right in the begining.
To implement the plugin approach and actually make the plugins, we took the existing code with preprocessor support. 
We started with replacing the object/classes, which we wanted to put into the plugin, in the places they were used by a empty interface for said plugin.
This resulted in errors which we would solve by adding functionality to the interface. 
It was a relatively simple process, but it was quite time consuming at the end.

We did not define an interface before implementing it, but rather changed it every time it required a new functionality (in an agile manner).
One notable exceptiosn, where big changes where needed, were in the UI classes, because javaFX requires the main function to implement Application. 
Using the #if's we could make program extention optional, but with the plugins we needed a structure that could support both platforms (javaFX and no javaFX).
