A small example project was made: https://github.com/sijmenvb/pluginLoaderExample/tree/master for loading the plugins. This was quite difficult to get right.
To implement this and actually make the plugins was done by taking our existing code. 
Replacing the object/classes that we wanted to put in the plugin by a empty interface for said plugin.
This would result in errors which we would solve by adding functionality to the interface. 
this was a relatively simple process but it was quite time consuming.

we did not define an interface before implementing it. so we changed the interface every time it required new functionality in an agile manner.
one notable exception where big changes where needed was in the UI since javafx requires the main function to implement Application. 
Using the #ifdev's we could make extending optional while with the plugins we needed a structure that could provide both platforms (javaFX and no javaFX).
