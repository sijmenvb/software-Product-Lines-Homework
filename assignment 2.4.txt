we decided to make a config class that stores the variables and processes the arguments input.

We have three optional arguments:
	-disablecolor
	-debug
	-nolog

disablecolor removes the color selector.

debug increases the level of debug information.

nolog disables all logging.

these are all optional.


the user can give these as runtime parameters.

logging in, sending and receiving messages are not toggelable since we considered them essential to the functionallity of the program.
